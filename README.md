# Cricket Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a project that demonstrates how to analyze cricket-related data using Python and Power BI. The project utilizes web scraping techniques, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to uncover insights from cricket datasets.

---

## **Project Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase the end-to-end process of data analytics, starting from data collection to interactive visualization. It focuses on cricket data to provide meaningful insights into player performances, team statistics, and match outcomes.

---

## **Key Features**

### 1. Web Scraping

- Extracts cricket data from publicly available websites using Python libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`.
- Collects information such as player statistics, match details, and historical data.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation

- Cleans raw data using Python's `pandas` library.
- Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and standardizes data formats.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Performs EDA using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas` to uncover patterns and trends.
- Key analyses include:
  - Player performance metrics.
  - Team win/loss ratios.
  - Insights into batting and bowling statistics.

### 4. Data Visualization in Power BI

- Creates interactive dashboards to visualize the cleaned data.
- Dashboards include:
  - Player performance dashboards.
  - Team statistics dashboards.
  - Match outcome visualizations.
